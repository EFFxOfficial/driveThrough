Built ~ 2 years ago when I first started getting into the web development world. Currently there are limitations since I haven't touched it within that time since I first built:

1. No database included, fully locally and manually controlled (The original McDonald's Drive Through communicates with sensors that triggers the car movement.
2. There is no support for more than 3 cars, they need to be controlled each point so they do not overlap.
3. The screen MUST be in full size, hence the full screen toggle button to make it look simmetrical (still need some touch, I did not know responsivity back then)

I will indeed try to get more free time to implement this system, the TODO list is:

1. Add a database so it can be used in dashboard with history.
2. With the database included, more doors are open, such as Charts to control how many cars have passed in the month, which hour has the most or least cars in the drive through, also filters to week, days, months, year, etc.
3. Add support for more cars than 3, so they all stack at the back of each other and move automatically when the car in front have left (still manually controlled since there is no sensor communication)
4. With the atabase included, there will be also built a table with all stores registered in the drive through, so they can see who is the fastest/slowest drive through, which store had more cars, etc.
5. There is no setting option, so I will indeed think of something to add there, such as hide some informations or reset the current hour (also turn off the communication with the database, language, etc)


The idea is massive, but the end product is what makes the developer motivated, who knows where it will end up at...?
